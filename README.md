# Alien Invasion Game

This is a Python practice project where I built a simple 2D game inspired by *Space Invaders*.  
The player controls a spaceship to shoot down alien fleets before they reach the bottom of the screen.  
This project was developed as part of my practice with Python and the Pygame library.

## Features
- Player-controlled spaceship with smooth movement
- Shooting bullets to destroy aliens
- Alien fleet movement with increasing difficulty
- Score tracking and game-over conditions
- Sound effects and basic animations (if supported)

## Tech Stack
- **Python 3**
- **Pygame**

## Purpose
This project was created as a **learning exercise** to explore:
- Game loops and frame updates
- Event handling (keyboard input)
- Object-oriented programming in Python
- Basic collision detection

## Future Improvements
- Add multiple levels with increasing difficulty
- Add power-ups and special weapons
- Improve graphics and animations
- Add a high-score leaderboard
